## What is Docker

> Docker is a software for managing containers

### Cool Story... What is a container

A standardized unit of software. A package of code and the dependencies.

The container always acts the same.

IE: A picnic basket contains everything you need to have a picnic. You can also share that basket with a friend.

different environements for production and development.
